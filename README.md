# scam-alert-landing

I want a responsive landing page. The whole page should say. "‚ö†Ô∏è SCAMMERS ALERT ‚ö†Ô∏è"

Then a short description that "Livearts, event organizers are scammers as they do not pay for services offered to them. Stay Away From Them."

This. Landing page should pop We with red color and white. Let it be sized well on all screens
